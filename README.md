# IncidenceEditor

This project contains a simple Node.js backend for managing incidences.

## Setup

1. Install **Node.js** (version 18 or later is recommended).
2. Navigate to the `backend` folder:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Running the server

From the `backend` directory, start the server with:

```bash
npm start
```

The server will run on port `3001`. To stop it press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where it is running.

## Notes

The previous Windows batch files (`start-app.bat` and `stop-app.bat`) have been removed. Use the `npm` commands above to run the backend on any operating system.
